  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    #   # Don't boot with headless mode
    #   vb.gui = true
    #
    #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "8192"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", "4"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--ioapic", "on"]
